# Contour Detection using OpenCV
https://learnopencv.com/contour-detection-using-opencv-python-c/
Using contour detection, we can detect the borders of objects, and localize them easily in an image. It is often the first step for many interesting applications, such as image-foreground extraction, simple-image segmentation, detection and recognition.
